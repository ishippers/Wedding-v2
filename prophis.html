			<h4>His Story</h4>
			</br>
			<p>One of the weirdest things about proposing to someone is remembering that they have no idea what you are planning. You second guess yourself a lot and think on more than one occasion that the passing comment you just made would give the game away. For those of you that don&rsquo;t know, Megan has wanted to be a spy ever since she was young. So of course she is rather perceptive at picking up on things. From the beginning I knew that the proposal would be one of the hardest things I would ever have to plan and pull off.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Sunday, October 27, may have been the day that it all came together but I had made my mind up about 8 months earlier. In February 2013 I told my parents that I wanted to make Megan my wife and that I was saving for a ring. It was a few months later after my mother had been to see my Grandmother in Australia that she took me too one side and showed me a beautiful ring which she believed belonged to her grandmother. When I saw the ring I knew it was exactly the kind of thing that Megan would love. I took it to the family jeweller and got it restored and polished. It was here that I found out that the ring was most likely made in around 1840 and therefore probably not my Great Grandmothers, but my Great Great Great Great Great Grandmothers.</p>
			</br>
			<p>So I had the ring that Megan deserved, now I just needed to ask her in an equally fitting way. I knew that there we lots of different places in London which had a special meaning to us. But none had as much as the OXO tower and the SouthBank where I had "looked after" Megan in August 2011, as a favour to her older sister.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Never being content with doing something simple I decided that the proposal should involve not only some of the places in London that mean a lot to us but also some of the people as well. So I started to call some of our closest friends and asked them to meet up with me on quiet Sunday afternoon.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Getting people to do meet you, in a specific place at a specific time, with out being able to give them good reason is really hard. In fact a few of them (they know who they are) were trying to bail or being really bad at committing so I had to send in Chris, the best man, to do a little bit of wrangling. Chris stepped up and having spent just over 6 months planning it looked like everything was going to come together nicely.</p>
