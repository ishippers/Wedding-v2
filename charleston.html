		<h1>Charleston</h1>
		<p>For us Charleston was the obvious choice for our wedding. It is the place where we first spent any real time together, the place that Edward escaped to far too many times in the first six months, and it is where we fell in love. </p>
		</br>
		<p>For those of you who aren&rsquo;t familiar with Charleston, it is the oldest city in South Carolina and is known for well-preserved architecture. An iconic part of Charleston&rsquo;s skyline is the Arthur Ravenell, Jr. bridge, which has a public footpath and is a great way to get a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the city and the port.</p>
		</br>
		<p>Whether you&rsquo;d like to get a taste of Southern food, tour historic buildings and homes, or spend some time at the beach while you&rsquo;re in Charleston for our wedding, we can promise that you&rsquo;ll find exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for.
		</p>
		</br>
		<p>Charleston has been voted the US&rsquo;s number one city for three years running by the readers of Conde Nast Traveler, <a href="http://www.cntraveler.com/daily-traveler/2013/10/charleston-south-carolina-number-one-city-in-the-united-states" target="_blank">click here</a> to see why we&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;ll love Charleston as much as we do.</p>
